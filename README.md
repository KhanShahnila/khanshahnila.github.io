### Introduction

As a certified Pharmacy Technician at Walmart with a background in healthcare and a strong foundation in Business Analysis, I bring a unique blend of skills to the table. Recently, I completed a comprehensive Business Analyst boot camp at TripleTen, where I gained expertise in tools and techniques such as Tableau, Power BI, SQL, Microsoft Excel, Pivot Tables, and presentation skills.

I’m passionate about leveraging data to drive informed decisions and improve business outcomes. My experience in customer-focused roles has honed my problem-solving abilities and communication skills, which I’m eager to apply in a Business Analyst role.

I'm actively seeking opportunities in Business Analysis where I can contribute my skills and continue learning. If you have an opportunity or would like to connect, feel free to reach out.
